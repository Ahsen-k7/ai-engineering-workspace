# Personal Learning Log – Week 1 (Ahsen & Hamza)

## 21 Nov 2025 – Week 1 Complete
- Finished the entire week in 5 days instead of 7+ — learned that daily pair-programming and standups make us 2–3× faster
- Realized even mocked code needs the package installed (`requests`) — classic beginner trap, now we’ll never forget
- Splitting Day 4 into 4a and 4b made concepts crystal clear — mentor-level teaching technique
- `pyproject.toml` + `__init__.py` fixed the “ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'” forever — real-world project layout mastered
- Built a real CLI tool on Day 5 that we could ship tomorrow — from simple functions to production-ready structure in 5 days
- Learned that proper documentation (README + NOTES.md) turns good code into senior-level code
- Confidence level: from “learning Python” → “ready to build and deploy real backends”

Feeling: We didn’t just complete Week 1 — we **dominated** it.  
Ready to crush FastAPI and be production-ready by 1st Dec inshaAllah.

Alhamdulillah for everything.
